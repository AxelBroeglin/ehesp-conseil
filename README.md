## General Information
The audit firm EHESP Conseil contacted me to create their new website. The firm needed a more modern website that they could manage themselves. I designed the site in close collaboration with the team, to best fit their needs, the team wrote the content and chose the photos, and we determined together the tools they would need for the back office.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Wordpress - Divi
- Javascript


## Features
- Presentation of the firm and its services

## Thought process
I planned most of the tasks to be done before the project started, in order to be as prepared as possible. I thought that a maximum of preparation on my side could compensate for the lack of availability of the firm due to its activity.


## Project Status
Unfortunately the perhaps too much planning coupled with long delays in client feedbacks prevented me from having a great flexibility on this project, which took 6 months to see the day in total. I would know in the future that it is better to plan less, or at least to take the time to create a more flexible organization, in order to compensate for the possible lack of availability of a firm like this.


## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ . I taught the firm how to use the website. They are able to update it by themselves now.


## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to the EHESP Conseil team for their collaboration.
